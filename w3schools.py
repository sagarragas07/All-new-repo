#Python is a popular programming language.Python can be used on a server to create web applications.It is used for:
#python is interpreted language means source code of a python program is conveted into bytecode that is then executed by the python vm
# it is used for :- web development (server-side),#system scripting,#mathematics,#software development,
#python do:-
#Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
#Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
#Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
#Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
#Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
#why python:-
#Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
#Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
#Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
#Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
#Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way
#python syntax:-
#Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
#Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
#Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
#print('sagar')                      #sagar
#print("Hello, World!")              #Hello, World!
#the indentation in Python is very important.Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
#if 5 > 2:
#	print("five is greater than two")                                 #(five is greater than two)
#The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.
#python variables:-In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it: x= 5  print(x)  #5  y = "Hello world!" print(y)   #Hello world!
#comments #single line '''multi line ''' """   """ Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:Comments can be used to explain Python code.Comments can be used to make the code more readable.Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
#variables: Variables are containers for storing data values.Python has no command for declaring a variable.A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
#x = 4       # x is of type int
#x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
#print(x)          #sally
#A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character,case-sensitive,alpha-numeric,cannot start with a number.  myvar = "John",_my_var = "John",MYVAR = "John"
#many values to multiple variables:x,y,z="orange","banana","cherry" print(x),print(y),print(z) and you can assign sm value to multiple variables in one line x = y = z = "orange"   print(x) print(y) print(z). and you can unpack collection of values in a list,tuple etc. fruits = ["apple","banana","cherry"] x, y, z = fruits print(x) . .
